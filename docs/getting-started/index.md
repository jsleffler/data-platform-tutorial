# Getting Started

Here are some of the guides to help you get started with setup and the first few tools.

I write these documents in such a way that I expect you to be able to find some things on your own, I am not going to hand hold you though all the basics, including making sure you don't spend money on GCP.

## Install

Install the following tools on your local machine and have them available. Follow the guides for your OS and IDE.

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
* [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
<!-- * [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) -->

## GCP Setup

You will we need a GCP account, we will do this very very basically so do not follow this for advice on security etc.

Go to [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) and "Start for free" and follow the instructions. You will need to provide a credit card but you will not be charged unless you upgrade to a paid account.

Best to create a new project for this work, you can do this in the GCP console.

## Git Setup

You will need a GitHub account and then create a repository for this work. Since we intend to use CI/CD and IaC, we will not be using the CLI or the GCP console to create resources, etc. We will only use if we really have to or explore.

Create an empty repo and add what you want to a README.md, commit it and create you main branch etc.
