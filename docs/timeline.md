# Timeline

This doc is where I will record what I did and in what order, also this is the best place to follow and find the order of guides to follow. Or, if you are looking for a challenge, just start at the end!

This is a checkbox list, so feel free to copy this file into you new repo (see Getting Started) and use it to track your progress. Do not think you have to complete each section in a day or any other time frame, take as much time as you need you may need to read around the subjects to get the most out of these guides, I do not go into a lot of depth.

## Getting Started - Setup, Terraform & GitHub Actions

### Setup

- [ ] Start by reading through the [intro](./README.md) and installing the tools
- [ ] Create your repository in GitHub and clone to your local machine
- [ ] Create the initial structure and commit your first files (e.g. README.md)
- [ ] Setup your GCP account and create a new project

### Terraform

- [ ] Start by reading around the subject of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Terraform
- [ ] Dive into the [Terraform Getting Started Guide](./getting-started/terraform.md)
- [ ] Ensure you have destroyed the resources you created in GCP

### GitHub Actions

- [ ] Start by reading around the subject of CI/CD
- [ ] *Optional:* read about some of the traditional tools of Jenkins, CircleCI and GitHub Actions
- [ ] Ensure you have finished the section on Terraform (we will need this for CI/CD)
