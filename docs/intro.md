# Data Platform - A Learning & Tutorial Repository

This repository will be an example data platform using specific technologies and cloud platforms. It is intended to be a place of learning and exploration for the author and anyone else.

## Overview

A Data Platform is a collection of technologies and services that enable the collection, storage, processing, and analysis of data. The platform is designed to be scalable, reliable, and secure. The platform is designed to be flexible and extensible to meet the needs of the organization.

This repository will provide code and tooling to build a data platform using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and DevOps practices, CI/CD. It will also provide examples of data ingestion, transformation and modelling. The scope is somewhat limited to that of a small to medium sized organization and the role of a Data Engineer; therefore data analysis, visualization and machine learning are not in scope.
